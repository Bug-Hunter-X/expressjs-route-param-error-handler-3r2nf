# Unhandled Error in Express.js Route Parameter Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications where route parameters are not properly validated or handled, leading to unexpected crashes or errors. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, and the `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution with improved error handling.  The issue is the lack of input validation and error handling for the route parameter `:id`.  This lack of input validation can cause problems such as unexpected application crashes or vulnerabilities.
